            <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages.</li>
            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.</li>
            <li>JavaScript: A programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Popular Front-End Frameworks and Libraries:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.</li>
            <li>Angular: A TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google.</li>
            <li>Vue.js: An open-source model–view–viewmodel front-end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="section">
          <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
          <p>Back-end development, also known as server-side development, involves creating and managing the server-side logic, database interactions, user authentication, and server configuration.</p>
          <h3>Key Technologies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Programming Languages: JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and C#.</li>
            <li>Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis).</li>
            <li>Server Management: Understanding of server architecture and handling server management, commonly using tools like Nginx, Apache, and Docker.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="section">
          <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
          <p>Full-stack developers have the skills to work on both the front-end and back-end of a web application. They understand how to build a complete web application from scratch.</p>

          <h2>Web Development Tools</h2>
          <p>To build and manage web applications, developers use a variety of tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Version Control Systems: Git is the most popular version control system used to track changes in the codebase.</li>
            <li>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Tools like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and WebStorm provide comprehensive features for coding.</li>
            <li>Package Managers: npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn help manage project dependencies.</li>
            <li>Task Runners and Module Bundlers: Tools like Gulp and Webpack automate repetitive tasks and bundle JavaScript modules for efficient loading.</li>
          </ul>
